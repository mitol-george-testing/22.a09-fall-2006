description: Details of dislocation emission in molecular dynamics simulation of a
  metal thin film under nanoindentation. For clarity only the "defective" atoms are
  displayed, each is color coded according to the number of its neighbors. (Most of
  the atoms in the simulation are essentially not perturbed by the indentation and
  therefore not shown.) (Image courtesy of Ju Li. Used with permission.)
